This project implements basic to work with orthogonal polynomials.
It does not work on its own, but rather needs to be included in
other projects, which also include treelm.

We are now including FXTPACK, and are working on integrating it to allow a
fast polynomial transformation directly from Legendre modes to Legendre nodes.
